# Sars-cov2-variant-tracking
Comparative Genomic and Phylogenetic Analysis of SARS-CoV-2 Variants Across Countries and Time Periods
This project focuses on analyzing SARS-CoV-2 viral genome sequences from publicly available sources across different geographic regions and time periods. Through sequence alignment, mutation identification, and phylogenetic tree construction, the project aims to track viral evolution patterns and understand how emerging variants diverge from reference strains.
